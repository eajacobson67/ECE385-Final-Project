# ECE385-Final-Project

Project Description:
  Using FPGA and SystemVerilog to create 3D ball shooting game.
  
Execution:
  This was the final project for ECE385, a class on FPGA programming.
  It was a partner project. The goal of the game is to shoot the balls spawning
  randomly on the screen with your crosshairs using the FPGA development board.
  We used Quartus to program the board.
  
Authors:
  Erik Jacobson and Nick Halteman
  
Note:
  Currently working on obtaining video of the program in action, as it's difficult to
  recreate the setup.
